Inequality, Gender and Human
Development in Africa

11.1 Introduction
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has witnessed impressive progress on human development
over the past 25 years. Indeed, using the Human Development Index (HDI) as a measure
of development, since 2000, SSA has experienced more rapid growth than any other
region, growing at 1.68 per cent from 2000 to 2010 and 0.94 per cent from 2010 to 2014
(UNDP, 2015a). The rate of progress in some countries – for example, Rwanda, Ethiopia and
Mozambique – has been particularly remarkable.
At the same time, inequality has become a central challenge for the region as it has for all other
regions of the world. Progress has been uneven between countries and various socioeconomic
groups and serious human deprivation remains. Income inequality is an important element
of inequality, but the trends capture only part of the story. The full realization of human
potential for all people also requires attention to inequalities in access to non-income resources,
including basic services such as health, education, political participation and access to property
and financial resources. In addition, some groups systematically have less access to income
and non-income resources than others. Women and girls in particular are, on average, more
deprived than men across all countries in the region. Ensuring equal access to opportunities
and services for women and girls would have significant positive implications for overall human
development progress in SSA.
This chapter employs the human development framework to examine the extent and nature of
inequality in SSA. It draws attention to the complex and multidimensional nature of inequalities
in the region, with a particular focus on gender inequalities, and points to policy interventions
that may help to close gaps. Section 11.2 introduces the human development paradigm and
presents an overview of inequality in key dimensions of human development. This section
also identifies some of the drivers of inequality in these dimensions and interlinkages among
inequalities in different dimensions, e.g. in education and income. Section 11.3 presents global
and regional inequality trends using the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index
(IHDI). Section 11.4 explores inequality trends by subregions in Africa and identifies some
key challenges for countries in the region related to gender inequality. Finally, Section 11.5
draws upon the previous analysis to outline policy priorities to close gaps in inequality in SSA.

11.2 Linkages and drivers of inequality in income and human development
11.2.1 The intersection of inequality in income and human development	
The human development paradigm places people at the centre of development. From this perspective,
“the objective of development is to create an enabling environment for people to enjoy long, healthy
and creative lives” (UNDP, 1990). It involves expanding political freedoms and guaranteeing basic
human rights. All people should be equipped with the knowledge and agency to make choices from
a range of accessible alternatives so as to enhance their well-being at every stage of existence. In
simple terms, human development is about enlarging people’s choices by improving their capabilities,
expanding their opportunities and removing the social, cultural or political barriers that may work
against them.
Equity and universal opportunities for people, in this generation and in subsequent generations,
to realize their full potential are central to the human development paradigm. Early Human
Development Reports emphasised universalism and the need to aim for a world where “no child
goes without an education, where no human being is denied healthcare and where all people can
develop their potential capabilities” (UNDP, 1994). The reports also emphasise that all people should
have the economic, social and political rights that allow them to make choices in line with their
values and aspirations. The full realization of human potential for all people requires policy attention
to inequalities in income and non-income resources, including basic services such as health and
education, political participation and access to property and financial resources.
Over the past 25 years, much progress has been made in many dimensions of human development:
people are living longer, healthier and more creative lives; people are more knowledgeable and have
access to resources needed to support a decent standard of living; more children are going to school;
incomes are higher; and more people live under democratic regimes with greater potential for political
engagement. In SSA, the number of children enrolled in primary education increased by 19 per cent
from 1990 to 2015 and child mortality dropped from 178.5 deaths per thousand live births to 91.2
over the same time period (UNDP, 2015a). Impressive progress in reducing poverty has been made
in The Gambia (32 per cent reduction since 1990), Burkina Faso, Niger, Swaziland, Ethiopia, Uganda
and Malawi (UNECA, 2015). And yet, in many cases, progress in the region is marked by high levels
of inequality in health, education and income, and in the urgency required to influence change. Gains
have not been universal and many people still suffer deprivations in basic elements of life.
There are significant differences in the human development of women and men as measured by the
HDI. This is the case even though women in the region have a longer life expectancy than men.
Much of the variation is due to women’s incomes falling far short of men’s and the levels of education
of adult women falling below adult men’s. In 2014, average per capita gross national income (PPP)
for women in the region was US$2,626 compared to US$4,148 for men (UNDP, 2015a). This is
despite a relatively high labour force participation rate among women in SSA (65.4 per cent) relative
to other regions. Part of the variation in the incomes of men and women is related to the nature of
the work that women do. They typically carry a disproportionate burden of the unpaid care work that
is performed in the home. And even when they have paid work, they are more likely than men to be
in vulnerable and informal jobs.
Those living in poverty at the bottom of income distributions, many of whom are women and girls,
and are often deprived in many other dimensions of human development, with implications for

socio-economic mobility. Across all regions, children in the lowest wealth quintile are more likely to
die before their fifth birthday than children in the wealthiest quintile. In SSA, child mortality rates
are about 67 per cent higher for the lowest quintile. These children are also almost twice as likely to
suffer stunting from chronic malnutrition (UNDP, 2013a). Similar gaps can be observed in education
outcomes. Children whose families are in the highest wealth quintile in the region are 60 per cent
more likely to complete primary school than children from the poorest quintile. Girls are even less
likely than boys to complete primary school (ibid.).
Health and education deprivation is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. In SSA, 77 per cent of
women in urban areas have access to maternal health care compared to only 38 per cent of women
living in rural areas. Globally, nearly half of people living in rural areas lack access to improved
sanitation facilities, whereas only 18 per cent of people in urban areas are without improved sanitation.
Children from rural areas are also less likely to be in school; worldwide, twice as many rural children
are out of school than in urban areas (UN, 2015). At the same time, levels of inequality in income
and in access to services, infrastructure and opportunities are higher in urban areas. Slum populations,
which make up 63 per cent of the urban population in the region, are deprived of many basic services
and opportunities (UN Habitat, 2013).
There are also inequalities in access to information and technology, which are key tools for empowering
people to expand their capabilities. In Africa, only one in every five people has access to the Internet
(ITU, 2015). Women disproportionately lack access in developing countries, where 16 per cent fewer
women than men use the Internet (ITU, 2013). This digital divide can perpetuate inequalities in
access to jobs and education and, in some cases, even limit opportunities for political participation.
Overcoming income inequalities and empowering women to participate in the labour market and
secure quality work is one way of ensuring that all people have opportunities to achieve their full
potential in life. However, from a human development perspective, there are many other inequalities
that deserve policy attention. For instance, more equitable access to health and education services and
information, and equal rights to participate in political decisions can significantly enlarge people’s
choices, particularly the most disadvantaged – women, the poor and those in rural areas.

11.2.2 Income inequality and sustainable human development
Income inequality can reinforce inequalities in health and education as well as work, political
participation and security. These overlapping inequalities perpetuate exclusion and deprivations
throughout the life course and across generations. As indicated in the section above, the poorest
quintiles of the population are often the most deprived in access to healthcare and education.
Access to quality health services is often limited for those living in poverty. Disparities in access to
healthcare across income groups can result in disparities in health outcomes across these groups. For
example, in Zambia, the poor are less likely to access public hospitals due to financial and physical
barriers, despite showing higher need than other income groups. They are also more likely to use
primary facilities such as health clinics, which have fewer resources (Phiri and Ataguba, 2014). In
South Africa, HIV prevalence is found to be higher among those in the poorest socioeconomic
groups. This may be due in part to access to information and access to HIV/AIDS testing. In one
study, only 20.5 per cent of the poor reported having access to information on HIV/AIDS compared
to 79.5 per cent of people from higher socioeconomic groups (Wabiri and Taffa, 2013). People who
live in poor communities also have a higher risk of dying from non-communicable diseases such
Chapter 11 Inequality, Gender and Human Development in Africa / 247

as lung cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular illnesses. This is due to a combination of inequalities
in risk and in access to healthcare for timely diagnosis and treatment, both of which are linked to
socioeconomic levels (Di Cesare et al., 2013).
Similar patterns are observed in access to education where the poor are disproportionately deprived,
particularly beyond the primary and secondary levels. In Ghana, for example, positive correlations are
found between poverty incidence and education inequalities, with additional deprivation experienced
by girls and those living in rural areas (Senadza, 2012). This is also the case in many other countries
in the region. A recent study by the Brookings Center for Universal Education’s Africa Learning
Barometer finds that individuals who are poor, female and attending school in rural communities in
the region are far less likely to be learning critical skills such as reading, writing and mathematics. The
study finds that people in extreme education poverty (less than two years of schooling) are much less
likely to learn (see figure 11.1) (Agbor, 2012). Disadvantages in opportunities for education, as with
healthcare, are linked to poverty and also to lower levels of access for girls and women and people
living in rural areas.
Income inequalities, as well as inequalities between men and women and those in rural and urban
areas, are reinforced across generations because deprivation in access to quality education and
healthcare limits opportunities for secure livelihoods. Indeed, studies in a number of countries
have found that parents’ educational attainment and earnings are two of the strongest predictors of
children’s educational attainment (Duncan and Murnane, 2011). In a world where advanced skills are

increasingly central to work across sectors and in all regions, these inequalities in education translate
into future inequalities in earnings (Autor, 2014). In South Africa, fathers pass on three-fifths of their
earnings advantage to sons, much of which is linked to the former’s level of education (Piraino, 2015).
In Senegal, parents’ education is also positively associated with the living standards of their adult
children and maternal education has a much larger positive effect than paternal education (Lambert,
Ravallion and Van de Walle, 2014).
In highly unequal societies, intergenerational mobility is limited. Parents’ levels of education, income
and health can greatly affect the opportunities available to their children unless policy interventions
are made to increase opportunities for mobility. This is particularly important for girls and people
living in rural areas, where low levels of access to quality education and healthcare are felt most
significantly. In this regard, the human development of future generations will depend on policy
actions taken today against the multiple dimensions of inequality.

11.2.3 Drivers of inequality in human development
Perpetuation of inequalities in income, health and education outcomes is linked to complex mixes of
discriminatory social norms and patterns of service provision, combined with exposure to conflict in
some cases, among other reasons. High levels of poverty and inequality combined with asymmetries
in access to health and education services are problematic. Today, many countries in SSA still feel the
effects of cost-cutting measures in education and health services that were implemented in the 1980s
and 1990s. This is especially the case in rural areas where cuts were the greatest and for girls, who
often forgo education when families cannot afford to send all of their children to school (Ombati
and Mokua, 2012). Expenditures on health and education services often disproportionately reach
wealthier populations. This is the case in Ghana, United Republic of Tanzania and South Africa,
where health services are directed toward rich populations even while the burden of illness is much
greater for low-income populations (Mills et al., 2012). There is some evidence that democratic
engagement may help direct government policies and expenditures toward improving health and
education outcomes. There is a strong correlation between the 2015 Economist Democracy Index
and HDI (0.60), indicating that when citizens have a greater say in decisions that affect them, overall
human development status is strengthened.
Studies have found that one of the single greatest potential equalisers in the region is increased access
to education, including access to technical, vocational and entrepreneurial education that increases
skills and employability (Anyanwu, Erhijakpor and Obi, 2016). Universal quality education and
health systems are essential. Access to public education is unlikely to reduce inequalities if teachers
are poorly trained, class sizes are large and resources are limited. In this instance, the children of
wealthy individuals are likely to go to private schools, obtaining higher-quality schooling than those
in the public system and maintaining inequalities. For example, in Kenya, after the introduction of
the Free Primary Education (FPE) programme in 2003, the proportion of children attending private
primary schools increased by 7 percentage points by 2007 as parents reacted to the quality of public
education (Nishimura and Yamano, 2013).
Social norms and traditions can also drive inequality by limiting opportunities for women and
minorities. For example, traditions dictating that women and girls carry a disproportionate burden
of unpaid work in the home limit their opportunities relative to men and boys (UNDP, 2015a).
According to time-use surveys in developing countries, traditional work divisions leave women
responsible for more than three-quarters of the time their household dedicates to unpaid care work.
Chapter 11 Inequality, Gender and Human Development in Africa / 249

In Mali, men spend 21 minutes per day doing unpaid work while women spend 241 minutes per
day in unpaid work. As such, women in Mali perform over ten times more unpaid work than men,
while men only do 42 per cent more paid work than women (ibid.). Women’s unequal contributions
to unpaid work reduce time available for education and activities that increase their preparation for
the job market and also limit the time they can commit to paid work. Women are also limited in
access to healthcare because of norms that reduce their decision-making authority in communities
and households. In Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda, surveys indicate that women are less likely to use
maternal health services when they live in areas that are relatively tolerant of violence against women
(Adjiwanou and LeGrand, 2014). Additionally, when traditional norms encourage early marriage
and childbearing, girls leave school at a young age and miss out on opportunities to expand their
education and gain skills that would empower them to consider different livelihoods.
Conflict remains a barrier to overcoming inequalities for many communities and countries, although
the number of countries in conflict in SSA has declined over the past 15 years. When individuals
live in fear of violence (either real or perceived), their abilities to make choices freely and access
opportunities are diminished. People may be afraid to leave their homes or communities, which limits
work, access to health services and schooling. When parents fear for the physical and sexual safety of
daughters, they are likely to keep them out of school (Pinheiro, 2006). Violence can magnify existing
inequalities within societies when certain groups are the targets of violence. Women and sexual, ethnic
and religious minorities, for example, are more likely to be threatened by violence, real or perceived,
which disproportionately constrains their opportunities (Stewart, 2008). In areas affected by conflict,
deficiencies in access to services and livelihoods can have lasting effects, stifling human potential
relative to those areas that are free of conflict. The result can be geographical inequalities in outcomes
across many dimensions of human development. Targeted action for populations affected by conflict
may help reduce these disparities and reinforce movements toward peace and social cohesion.

11.3 Measuring inequality in human development
11.3.1 The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index
Recognizing inequality as a central policy challenge for sustainable human development, the 2010
UNDP Human Development Report (HDR) introduced a new index for monitoring levels of
inequality across dimensions of human development. The Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) is a
composite index that accounts for inequality in the three dimensions of the HDI – the ability to
live a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. The IHDI accounts
for inequalities in HDI dimensions by ‘discounting’ each dimension’s average value according to
its level of inequality. Under perfect equality, the HDI and the IHDI are equal. If distribution of
income, health and/or education is unequal, the IHDI is lower than the HDI. The higher the level
of inequality in a society, the greater the difference becomes between the HDI and the IHDI. In this
sense, the IHDI gives an indication of the actual level of human development (taking into account
inequality), while the HDI reflects the ‘potential’ human development that could be achieved if there
were no inequality. Loss in potential human development due to inequality is the difference between
the HDI and the IHDI and is expressed as a percentage.
The IHDI is calculated using the following indicators and sources of data:1
See Human Development Report Technical Notes for further details (UNDP, 2015b).

1

250 / Income Inequality Trends in sub-Saharan Africa: Divergence, determinants and consequences

• Distribution of health is calculated based on differences in life expectancy using data from the
abridged life tables of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN
DESA).

• Distribution of education is calculated based on differences in mean years of schooling using data
from various household surveys.

• Distribution of income is calculated based on differences in disposable household income or
consumption per capita using data from various household surveys.

Data in each of these dimensions are used to calculate an Atkinson index on inequality.2 Atkinson
measures for each dimension are then used to adjust the respective HDI dimensions for inequality.
These adjusted dimensions are then aggregated using a geometric mean to produce the IHDI (Alkire
and Foster, 2010; Foster, Lopez-Calva and Szekely, 2005:1).

11.3.2 Mapping the status of inequality in human development across regions
The IHDI is a powerful tool for inequality analysis that reveals trends and patterns that can guide
policy-making. The IHDI indicates that inequality is one of the main drags on human development
progress, resulting in an overall loss at the global level of 22.8 per cent of human development potential.
The ranking of some of the leading countries in the Human Development Index drops significantly
when inequality is taken into account: the United States (about 20 positions); the Republic of Korea
(about 19 positions); and Chile (about 13 positions) in 2014. For developing countries, loss in HDI
due to inequality is 25.7 per cent. The loss is highest in low human development countries, indicating
that not only are levels of human development low, but they are also extremely unequal (see table 11.1).

In SSA, loss of human potential due to inequality is 33 per cent. In South Asia and the Arab States,
it is over 25 per cent (see figure 11.2). In four countries – the Central African Republic, Comoros,
Namibia and Sierra Leone – the IHDI is more than 40 per cent lower than the HDI. In 35 other
countries, it is 30-40 per cent lower.
Today, public concern over inequality is focused mostly on income, but the IHDI shows that globally,
based on the Atkinson inequality index, inequalities in education are highest, with 27 per cent,
followed by income at 24 per cent and health at 17 per cent. Inequalities in education are the most
extreme in South Asia (42 per cent), the Arab states (39 per cent) and SSA (35 per cent). Inequalities
in education garner less attention than inequalities in income, but are perhaps even more worrisome
2

The IHDI draws on the Atkinson (1970) family of inequality measures and sets the aversion parameter equal to 1.1 The inequality measure is A = 1 – g/µ,
where g is the geometric mean and µ is the arithmetic mean of the distribution.

from a long-term development perspective, as previously discussed. Health inequalities are highest in
SSA, at 37 per cent, followed by South Asia, at 24 per cent. Income inequalities are highest in Latin
America and the Caribbean, at 35 per cent, followed by East Asia and the Pacific and SSA, at 27 per
cent. This is similar to the income Gini coefficients, which are also highest for Latin America and the
Caribbean (World Bank, 2015).
Patterns of change in recent years indicate some promise for the future if efforts to reduce inequalities
are stepped up. As measured by the IHDI, inequality in human development has declined slightly in
most regions since 2010, except for SSA where it has not changed. Declines have been driven mainly
by reductions in health inequality in all regions, whereas inequality in years of schooling has remained
mostly constant and inequality in income has risen in several regions, including SSA and South Asia.
But there have also been declines in income inequality in some countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia.
Regional trends that are revealed with the IHDI still mask much variation across countries within
regions in terms of levels of inequality and directions of change. In SSA, for example, figures 11.3 to
11.5 show Atkinson inequality measures for each of the HDI dimensions by country for 2010 and
2014.3 Countries falling above the 45 degree line have shown increasing levels of inequality, while those
falling below the line show declining levels of inequality. Almost all countries have lower levels of health
inequality with the exception of Sierra Leone, Comoros and Togo. Changes in education and income
inequalities are fluctuating, with some countries making great strides to reduce inequalities and others
experiencing increased inequality levels. Mozambique and Ethiopia have seen steep drops in income
inequality, while Swaziland and Cabo Verde have moved toward greater equity in education.
Measures of inequality may be from surveys for years earlier than the year listed.

The following sections provide more details on the degrees of multidimensional inequality in the
region and point to some policy options for the future to move toward a more equitable distribution
of opportunities and human potential.

11.4 Exploring trends in human development and income inequality
11.4.1 Trends in human development by subregion and human development grouping
Starting from a low base in 1990, SSA has made significant strides in human development. From
1990 to 2014, SSA was the third-fastest improving region in terms of human development, behind
South and East Asia. In 1990, the level of human development in SSA was 62 per cent lower than
the highest performing region, which was Europe and Central Asia. By 2014, this gap had shrunk to
45 per cent, behind HDI levels in Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean,
which are the two best performing regions. The latest HDI reveals that 17 African countries across
all subregions have now achieved medium and high human development status (UNDP, 2015).
Yet, the majority of countries remain in the low human development category, which has negative
implications for the well-being of present and future generations. Three out of every four Africans
live in a country with poor foundations for human development, while globally, one in every five
individuals lives in a low human development country (UNDP, 2015). Africa is a youthful continent,
with over 50 per cent of the population under the age of 18.5 years and 19 per cent of the population

between the ages of 15 and 24 years (UN DESA, 2015). This deficit in terms of human development,
therefore, has tremendous short- and long-term implications for inclusive growth and development.
Recent improvements in human development are the result of improvements in income as well as
non-income dimensions of human development. African countries making the fastest improvement
in human development have enhanced both their income and non-income dimensions of human
development. A review of the annual change in income and non-income dimensions of human
development in the top 20 African countries from 2005 to 2012 shows that 60 per cent of the
countries had improvements in both income and non-income dimensions. The remaining 35 per cent
had more improvement in non-income dimensions, while only 5 per cent had improvements mainly
in income dimensions (UNDP, 2013b).
It is important to note that African countries with low human development are catching up fast.
African low human development countries are improving their levels of human development faster
than high human development African countries. Countries making the fastest progress since 2000
include Angola, Burundi, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia,
Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone,
United Republic of Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Together, these countries represent
a significant proportion of Africa’s population. They also represent a mix of natural resource-rich
countries as well as those that are more diversified. This indicates the importance of effective use of
available resources, beyond resource abundance, in promoting human development. In addition, there
seems to be a peace dividend, as countries coming out of conflict recover lost ground.
The global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which examines both incidence and intensity
of poverty in three dimensions – health, education and living standards – shows a similar picture to
that of the HDI in terms of Africa’s progress in reducing poverty. A key finding of the Global MPI
(2016) is that for the 35 African countries where changes to poverty over time were analysed, 30
have reduced poverty significantly. Rwanda had the fastest reduction in MPI, followed by Ghana,
Liberia, Comoros and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In addition, every MPI indicator was
significantly reduced in Burkina Faso, Comoros, Gabon, Mozambique and Rwanda. Some countries,
such as Gabon, Ghana, The Gambia, Liberia, Mozambique, Malawi, Niger and Rwanda, managed to
reduce poverty in every region, indicating equitable progress in poverty reduction (Alkire et al., 2016).
However, the rate of change in human development has slowed since 2010. Therefore, although the
gap between low and high human development African countries is closing, this growth needs to be
sustained. The growth slowdown is a clear concern, as at least 17 African countries remain in the low
human development category. In some instances, this disruption was caused by insecurity, as in the
case of the Central African Republic and South Sudan. The impact of the global financial crisis on
levels of foreign direct investment in the economies most integrated in the global financial market
is also evident mainly for ‘high human development’ countries in North Africa. Finally, commodity
price volatility also played a role in reducing income growth in natural resource- and agricultural
commodity-dependent countries such as Botswana, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique and Uganda.
This slowdown in the rate of improvement of human development is not uniform across the subregions. In the 1990s, East and North Africa had the fastest improvement in human development.
This shifted to East and West Africa from 2000 and in West and Southern Africa starting in 2010.
While there is a pattern in slowing improvement in human development across all subregions,
Southern, Central and West Africa experienced the smallest reductions, from 30 to 40 per cent. The

rate of improvement fell more sharply in East Africa with a reduction of 60 per cent, mainly due to
a slowdown in Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. However, despite the general slowdown, a number
of countries continued on an upward trajectory in improving their levels of human development,
including Gabon, Lesotho, Seychelles, South Africa and Togo.

Chapter 11 Inequality, Gender and Human Development in Africa / 257

Countries making the fastest progress also tend to have low inequality; countries with lower inequality
in human development indicators grew faster on average than those with higher levels of inequality.
For instance, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Burundi and Mozambique grew faster than Benin, Botswana and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The latter have higher levels of inequality in education,
health and income distribution across the population. This is indicated by a higher overall loss in
human development, shown by a large difference between the HDI and the Inequality-adjusted
HDI, expressed as a percentage.

11.4.2 Trends in inequality by subregion and human development grouping
High human development countries seem to be associated with lower levels of overall HDI inequality.
As previously mentioned, SSA countries have the highest losses in terms of human development
when distribution of outcomes across the population is taken into account. However, in general, lower
human development African countries face higher levels of inequality than medium and high human
development African countries.
Yet, when dimensions of inequality in human development are considered, each human development
group experiences a distinct driver of inequality. For instance, the importance of education inequality
relative to income and health inequality is higher in high human development countries. In low
human development countries, inequality in education and health contributes relatively more to
overall inequality in HDI than inequality in income. In medium human development countries, the
impact of income inequality overrides education and health inequalities.
In addition to inequality across the population, all African countries struggle with some form of gender
inequality. Overall, high human development countries have lower gender gaps in terms of women’s

health, empowerment and economic activity, compared to low human development countries, as
captured by UNDP’s Gender Inequality Index (GII). The GII reflects gender-based inequalities in
three dimensions: reproductive health, measured by maternal mortality and adolescent birth rates;
empowerment, measured by the share of parliamentary seats held by women and attainment in
secondary and higher education by each gender; and economic activity, measured by labour market
Chapter 11 Inequality, Gender and Human Development in Africa / 259

participation rates for women and men. The GII can be interpreted as the loss in human development
due to inequality between female and male achievements in the three GII dimensions.
However, relatively lower levels of gender inequality in high human development African countries
mask significant economic gaps related to women’s participation in the labour forces. For instance,
many countries in North Africa face challenges in ensuring economic empowerment through women’s
participation in the labour force. By contrast, low human development countries have more women in
the workforce but high inequality in health and education outcomes. This may have an impact on the
effectiveness of women’s participation in the labour force as they are overrepresented in the informal
sector and in vulnerable employment. Gender inequality in the labour market results in lost benefits
at individual, household and society levels. It is estimated that Africa faces significant economic losses
annually due to gender gaps in labour force participation of up to US$95 billion annually for SSA
(Bandara, 2015).
Another persistent gender gap across most African countries is in political dimensions. A wide
gap remains in women’s and men’s political representation, and in leadership, despite significant
progress in some countries. For instance, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Mozambique and Zimbabwe
have shown tremendous improvement, with 40 to 50 per cent representation of women in single
or combined national parliaments (IPU, 2016). This goes well beyond the minimum one-third in
most national constitutions. However, there is a wide gap in African country performance, with 37
African countries at a lower level of representation than the SSA average of 23 per cent. In at least
10 countries, the level of representation is below 10 per cent, with the lowest in Central African
Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Comoros, Nigeria and Swaziland (IPU, 2016).
Disparities related to income and sex are compounded by inequality due to geographic location
and age. At present, the majority of young Africans live in poverty and work at an early age rather
than further their education. It is estimated that up to 17 per cent of Africa’s 15-17 year olds are
working and out of school, compared to 15 per cent in Asia and the Pacific and only 2.2 per cent in
Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ILO, 2015). Youth aged between 15 and 24 years who are working,
including those in urban areas, are more likely to live in poverty. While globally, two-thirds of youth
can be categorized as working poor, in SSA, nine out of ten working youth are poor or near poor
(ILO, 2015). The highest proportion of working poor youth are found in South Asia (94 per cent),
followed by SSA (93 per cent) and South East Asia and the Pacific (67 per cent). These rates are
likely a reflection of the higher proportion of youth still in school in these regions, rather than in the
workforce.

11.4.3 Gender inequality and human development
As discussed in preceding sections, the underlying drivers of inequality in human capabilities include
unequal participation in political and economic life; unequal access to economic, financial and natural
resources; lack of human security and rights; and inequitable outcomes and opportunities for women
and men. Inequitable distribution of national resources, differences in power to influence decisionmaking and existing discriminatory social institutions and norms, especially gender inequality, also
act as key transmission channels for inequality in African countries.
There is a negative relationship between human development and gender inequality in Africa, as
demonstrated in figure 11.11, which maps the level of human development against the level of
gender inequality. Countries with overall low levels of gender inequality, such as Libya, Tunisia and

Mauritius, tend to have higher levels of human development. By contrast, countries such as Niger,
Chad, Central African Republic, Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with higher levels
of gender inequality, also tend to have lower levels of human development.
African countries have responded to gender inequality by putting in place legislative frameworks and
institutions at regional, subregional and national levels, and targeted programmes to reduce gaps in
education and health, as well as providing dedicated resources, yet this problem persists. In view of
the persistent nature of gender inequality in Africa, it is useful to examine the root causes to inform
a more effective response. The Africa Human Development Report 2016 (UNDP, 2016) explores the
policy agenda and actions needed to accelerate gender equality and women’s empowerment in Africa.
One of the key findings is that social institutions and norms play a critical role in perpetuating gender
inequality. For instance, there is ample evidence that countries with high gender inequality and the
presence of discriminatory social institutions, as illustrated in UNDP’s Gender Inequality Index and
OECD’s Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI), tend to have poorer human development
outcomes for women than for men. These discriminatory social institutions limit women’s decisionmaking power and status in the home, increase their vulnerability to violence, lead to unequal care
for children (favouring sons) and reduce women’s access to resources and participation in politics and
public life.

Chapter 11 Inequality, Gender and Human Development in Africa / 261

While these findings do not establish causality, they do indicate that tackling the root causes of gender
inequality may be a useful channel toward improving the lives of both women and men. To this end,
the Africa Human Development Report proposes a five-fold approach toward the achievement of
sustainable human development by accelerating gender equality and the empowerment of women.
This approach first shifts the focus from gender equality as a separate outcome to advancing gender
equality and women’s empowerment as a critical enabler of all development outcomes. Second, it
encourages strong leadership and accountability in tackling destructive social norms in all their forms
and at all levels. Third, it calls for strategic choices in planning and budgeting that forgo the shortterm gains of the status quo in favour of investments toward a more empowered and inclusive growth
trajectory. It also calls for more adaptive, socially responsive, representative institutions and better data
for effective decision-making. Finally, this approach fosters regional and South-South cooperation in
the design and implementation of gender-focused policies and initiatives.

11.5 Policy response to reduce inequality in human development and achieve Agenda
2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals
In view of the preceding analysis, this section draws upon the findings from a review of Africa’s
progress toward global and regional development goals, including the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) (AU et al. 2015). The focus is on providing key policy conclusions that contribute to
closing the human development gap in SSA by accelerating achievement of the new global Agenda
2030 for Sustainable Development (Agenda 2030) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.
Africa’s economic structure offers some insights into poverty, growth and inequality dynamics on
the continent. The composition of GDP by sector is telling in terms of the wealth redistribution
channels for poverty reduction. There have been shifts in all sectors from 2000 to 2014, particularly in
agriculture, which has traditionally provided a source of livelihood for most of the African population,
albeit at a subsistence level. Unlike the structural transformation seen in other regions, however, the
shift away from agriculture has not been toward manufacturing or labour-intensive industry, but
rather services, which has not created sufficient jobs for the majority. This trend is a cause for concern
because it has not encouraged the growth of labour-intensive industry and light manufacturing for
inclusive growth or provided building blocks for diversification and dynamism in local economies.
Addressing the underlying causes of the different dimensions of inequalities, it can be observed that
SSA will put the region on a better footing toward sustainable development. High levels of inequality
have proven to be less poverty-reducing because the benefits of growth accrue to a few individuals
(non-inclusive growth), hence the slower-than-anticipated pace of poverty reduction in Africa,
despite a decade of strong growth. Using the Gini measure, SSA is on average more unequal relative
to the rest of the developing world. Africa’s mean Gini coefficient4 stands at 0.43, whereas for other
non-African developing countries, the average Gini coefficient is lower, at 0.39 (Bhorat, 2015). SSA
alone had an average Gini coefficient of 0.44 in 2015, slightly higher than the continental average (see
below), with mostly the Southern and Central African subregions pushing up the regional average.
Angola, Botswana, Central African Republic, Comoros, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia
have exceptionally high income inequalities, which have tended to increase the overall result for
The Gini index measures the extent to which distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within
an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. It is expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under a line. Thus, a Gini index of 0
represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality (World Bank, 2016).

Africa. Removing these seven outlier countries puts Africa at the same level of inequality as other
developing countries (Bhorat et al., 2016). These trends have almost mirrored (in reverse) poverty
reduction trends in many countries. Poverty has tended to decrease much faster in economies with
relatively lower income inequalities and more diversified economic structures than countries with
large enclave sectors that have higher returns on capital relative to labour. Ultimately, for Africa to
significantly reduce poverty, the economic structure must shift more toward light manufacturing
and industrialisation to create employment and a more sustainable human development path for the
continent.

11.5.1 Macro and sector policy responses at national, regional and continental levels
Economic structural transformation. Africa needs to transform its economic structures to diversify
its economic base, create jobs for the many unemployed youth and women, and start reversing the
high inequality trends on the continent. Important lessons abound on the impact on poverty and
inequality trends of the growth that Africa has enjoyed for the past ten years. Progress on poverty
eradication will depend largely on sustained industrialisation and agricultural transformation.
Macroeconomic and political stability. Development has occurred where there has been a stable
and conducive environment for investments and growth. Past growth rates have been buoyed in part
by stable operating environments. Africa is inundated with examples of development reversals due to
unstable economic and political environments. Achieving most, if not all, of the SDGs will depend
on stability in operating environments.
Sustainable urbanisation. Africa has the opportunity to promote sustainable urbanisation to
accelerate inclusive structural transformation and poverty and inequality reduction. This will involve
the promotion of sustainable livelihoods and access to public services – transport, infrastructure,
housing, water, sanitation and energy – for Africa’s rising population. National institutions will have
to address simultaneous environmental challenges, such as land, water and air pollution due to rapid
urbanisation, including the additional pressures from climate change. Investment will be required
to develop urban connectivity to exploit economies of agglomeration for structural transformation.
Finally, there is a need for measures to mitigate the impact of urban expansion into rural areas, which
include changing land use patterns and skewed land distribution impacts.

11.5.2 E nabling frameworks to harness new actors, partners and emerging opportunities
Domestic resource mobilisation. Financing plays a substantial role in determining areas of
investment and development outcomes. The MDG agenda depended largely on ODA. Countries will
have to design innovative policies for domestic resource mobilisation in order to finance the SDGs.
The anticipated structural transformation and growth will have to come with changes in national and
global tax policies in order to fairly distribute the burden of financing public spending.
Infrastructure development. Infrastructure has the potential to contribute to sustainable development
by connecting citizens and firms to economic opportunities. Africa has large infrastructure deficits
in transportation (roads, air and rail), energy (electricity and water) and technology. Removing
infrastructure deficits would spur economic activity and growth, as well as provide significant benefits
for human development. Investing in Africa’s infrastructure will drastically reduce the cost of doing
business on the continent and boost trade, achieve the regional integration objectives under Agenda
2063 and raise the quality of life by increasing access to markets, education and health opportunities.
Chapter 11 Inequality, Gender and Human Development in Africa / 263

Regional integration. Regional integration is a pathway for countries to achieve economic, social
and environmental priorities toward more sustainable and equitable human development. Regional
integration consists of uniting countries, institutions, people and ideas by eliminating barriers to
trade, harmonizing standards and regulatory frameworks, enhancing financial flows and labour
mobility, adopting common approaches to fiscal and monetary policies, promoting peace and conflict
prevention, and carrying out joint investment in cross-border infrastructure (transport, power and
communications). Accelerating the pace of regional integration will require greater policy coherence
across national and regional policies and more effective leadership of regional institutions that are
accountable to member states. In addition to providing the necessary funding, technical and human
resources required, regional institutions must ensure that citizens have a say in key decisions taken at
the regional level in order to ensure broad buy-in.

11.5.3 Key investment focus areas with multiplier effects for achieving the
Sustainable Development Goals
Human capital development and youth empowerment. Building human capital will continue to
demand attention in Africa in the medium to long term. With improvements in some of the human
development indicators and not in others, there is room to finish the unfinished business of the MDG
agenda for meaningful development to take place on the continent. SDGs 1 (poverty eradication), 2
(food security), 3 (health), 4 (education), 5 (gender equality) and 6 (sanitation) will be at the centre
of this development objective.
Resilience building. Africa remains vulnerable to shocks, disasters and conflicts, which continue to
erode the continent’s development progress. Rollbacks in progress have resulted from: the commodity
price decline; domestic conflicts in many of the countries, especially in Central Africa; increases in
violent extremism activities; climate change effects, as seen in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and
Southern African regions; and the recent Ebola crisis. Building strong socioeconomic, governance
and environmental systems to withstand such shocks, in addition to implementing effective social
protection policies and programmes will have to be part and parcel of the new agenda for sustainable
development.
Accelerating gender equality and women’s empowerment. Ensuring that women receive the same
economic, social and political opportunities by shifting from the current situation of legal gender
equality to more substantive gender equality offers a pathway to more inclusive economic growth
and human development. This entails supporting adoption of legal reforms, policies and programmes
to advance women’s empowerment. It also requires supporting national capacities to promote and
increase women’s participation and leadership in decision-making in the home, the economy and
society. In addition, the capacity to implement multi-sectoral approaches to mitigate the impacts of
discriminatory health and education practices must be enhanced. Finally, supporting women to gain
ownership and management of economic and environmental assets is fundamental.
